# Game Modularization Plan

## 1. Core Game Module (core.js)
- Initialize game state
- Game loop
- Save/Load game
- Reset game
- Debug mode

## 2. State Management Module (state.js)
- Game state object
- Functions to update state
- Constants (UPGRADES, ACHIEVEMENTS, etc.)

## 3. UI Module (ui.js)
- Update UI elements
- Handle UI interactions
- Render game modules (party, resources, etc.)

## 4. Resource Management Module (resources.js)
- Gather food, water, wood
- Resource generation (well, lumber mill)
- Resource consumption

## 5. Party Management Module (party.js)
- Create party members
- Manage party actions (eat, drink, sleep)
- Handle party member stats (health, hunger, thirst, energy)

## 6. Upgrade System Module (upgrades.js)
- Manage upgrades
- Unlock/buy upgrades
- Apply upgrade effects

## 7. Farming Module (farming.js)
- Manage farming grid
- Plant/water/harvest crops

## 8. Hunting Module (hunting.js)
- Manage hunting mechanics
- Start/stop hunting
- Handle animal movement and capture

## 9. Events Module (events.js)
- Random events generation
- Event effects and outcomes

## 10. Achievement System Module (achievements.js)
- Track achievements
- Check and unlock achievements

## 11. Logging Module (logging.js)
- Add log entries
- Manage log history

## 12. Utility Module (utils.js)
- Helper functions (random number generation, etc.)
- Time conversion functions

## 13. Constants Module (constants.js)
- Define constants for game mechanics
- Define constants for upgrades, achievements, etc.

## Implementation Steps:
1. Create separate files for each module in a 'modules' directory.
2. Move relevant code from game.js to each module file.
3. Export necessary functions and objects from each module.
4. Create a main.js file to import and initialize all modules.
5. Update index.html to use main.js as the entry point.
6. Refactor code to use imports where needed across modules.
7. Test thoroughly to ensure all functionality works as before.

Note: Some functions may need to be split or refactored to fit into the new modular structure. Pay special attention to functions that may have dependencies across multiple modules.
