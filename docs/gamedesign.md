- Gameplay and Mechanics:
  - Balance consistent growth with occasional explosive boosts: Provide a steady sense of progress, but include periodic large upgrades or achievements to keep players excited.
  - Implement multiple interacting systems: Create depth by having various game elements influence each other, encouraging players to strategize and optimize.
  - Gradual complexity increase: Start simple and introduce new mechanics over time to avoid overwhelming players while maintaining long-term interest.
  - Automation progression: Allow players to automate earlier, repetitive tasks as they advance, shifting focus to higher-level strategy.
  - Meaningful choices: Incorporate decisions that significantly impact gameplay, giving players a sense of agency and encouraging different playstyles.
  - Active vs idle balance: Design both active and idle gameplay elements, with active play being slightly more rewarding to incentivize engagement without punishing idle players.
  - Clear progression path: Provide visible goals and milestones to give players a sense of advancement and accomplishment.
  - Prestige mechanics: Consider including reset systems that offer powerful bonuses, adding replayability and long-term engagement.

- User Experience:
  - Intuitive UI design: Create a clean, easy-to-understand interface that gradually reveals new features to avoid information overload.
  - Visual progress indicators: Implement clear visual representations of advancement, such as progress bars or evolving graphics, to reinforce the sense of growth.
  - Thematic coherence: Develop a consistent theme or storyline to tie game elements together, enhancing immersion and player investment.
  - Clear explanations: Provide detailed, accessible information about game mechanics, upgrades, and their effects to help players make informed decisions.
  - Forgiving experimentation: Allow players to try different strategies without severe penalties, encouraging exploration and learning.
  - Quality-of-life features: Implement conveniences like auto-buyers, offline progress, and save systems to improve the overall player experience.

- Game Balance:
  - Careful exponential scaling: Balance growth carefully to maintain challenge and prevent earlier content from becoming trivial too quickly.
  - Ongoing relevance: Ensure that all currencies, upgrades, and systems remain meaningful throughout the game's lifespan.
  - Avoid excessive grinding: Strike a balance between rewarding dedication and respecting the player's time to prevent frustration.
  - Comprehensive testing: Conduct thorough playtesting to fine-tune pacing, difficulty, and overall game feel.

- Development Approach:
  - Iterative prototyping: Begin with a basic working version and refine based on player feedback and testing results.
  - Core gameplay focus: Solidify the fundamental game loop before adding excessive complexity or features.
  - Innovative design: Strive for creativity in mechanics or presentation rather than simply replicating existing games.
  - Audience consideration: Tailor the game's complexity and session length to your target player base.
  - Long-term planning: Design with future content updates and player retention in mind.

- Optional Features:
  - Multi-layered prestige: Implement multiple reset tiers for extended gameplay and strategic depth.
  - Achievement systems: Include challenges and accomplishments to provide additional goals and rewards.
  - Supplementary activities: Add mini-games or side quests to diversify gameplay and maintain interest.
  - Community elements: Consider adding social features like clans or leaderboards to foster player interaction.

- Things to Avoid:
  - Excessive clicking: Minimize repetitive manual actions that can lead to player fatigue or encourage the use of auto-clickers.
  - Overly complex systems: Avoid implementing mechanics that are too convoluted without proper explanation or gradual introduction.
  - Over-reliance on RNG: While some randomness can add excitement, avoid making core progression heavily dependent on chance.
  - Mandatory active play: Respect players' time by not requiring constant attention for extended periods to make meaningful progress.
