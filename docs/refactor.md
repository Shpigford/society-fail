Your job is to take the given code block and simplify + refactor it while adding thorough documentation.

Use simple block comments to explain the code.

/**
 * This is a JSDoc comment block.
 * It uses the double asterisk syntax at the start.
 * Each line begins with an asterisk.
 * JSDoc comments can include special tags for documenting code.
 * 
 * @example
 * // Example usage:
 * function exampleFunction() {
 *   console.log("This function is documented with JSDoc");
 * }
 * 
 * @see {@link https://jsdoc.app/} for more information on JSDoc
 */

Use single-line comments within functions to explain the code.
