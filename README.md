# Society Fail

Society Fail is a browser-based incremental clicker game built by [@Shpigford](https://twitter.com/Shpigford).

It was built almost exclusively using AI.

## Running locally

I've tried to keep it as simple as possible. You just open the index.html file directly in your browser. Seriously. No build process. No dependencies. Just pure, post-apocalyptic partying.

## Contributing

Want to contribute? Please do! Just open an issue for feature requests or submit a PR.

The `docs/gamedesign.md` is a solid file to reference when using AI to make changes/additions as it contains a lot of rules/logic/best practices for this type of game.
